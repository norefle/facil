# Bug: change name of the board in config.

## Description

If the config was changed inmmediately after creation and the some board
was renamed from default one (in config only) or some additional boards
were added then the following error would be shown for status command:


````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
lua: ...facil/status.lua:115: attempt to compare two nil values
stack traceback:
        ...facil/status.lua:115: in function
<...facil/status.lua:112>
        [C]: in function 'sort'
        ...facil/status.lua:112: in function 'status'
        fl/status.lua:12: in function '?'
        facil/src/fl.lua:56: in function
<facil/src/fl.lua:41>
        (tail call): ?
        [C]: ?
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

## Acceptance criteria

* Differences should be ignored: the boards which are existing in
  both config and filesystem should be taken into account.
* Create task for either implementation reinitialization for boards or
  for initialization with defined config.
