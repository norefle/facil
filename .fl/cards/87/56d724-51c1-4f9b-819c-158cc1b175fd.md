# Tasks archiving.

## Description

As a user I want to have possibility to archive the tasks from the board.
All archived tasks should be invisible in the output of status command.

Meanwhile I want to have command to show all archived tasks to get their
ids for further working (ie. showing, moving, editing).

## Acceptance criteria

1. fl archive [--older={day|week|month|year|id}|--all|--tag="tag"]
   archives tasks in final (only) lane. default behaviour --older=month.
2. fl archive removes markers from board, mark card as archived.
3. fl list shows all tasks ever created (probably all closed only)
   similarly to status, though without separation (one list).
