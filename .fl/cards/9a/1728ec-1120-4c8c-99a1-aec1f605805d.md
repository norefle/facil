# Bug: create and init use currentdir.

## Description

fl create and fl init use currentdir to find/create .fl directory.

How to reproduce:
1 chdir to dir with .fl: $ORIGIN
2 change .fl/config file to some non default values
3 initialize fl outside of $ORIGIN: $NEW

Result:
file $ORIGIN/.fl/config will be rewritten

Expected:
file $NEW/.fl/config should be created, when file $ORIGIN/.fl/config
have to be unchanged.

## Acceptance criteria

* fl init and fl create uses root directory with .fl instead of currentdir.
