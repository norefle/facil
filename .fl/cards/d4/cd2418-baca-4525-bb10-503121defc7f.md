# Limited output

## Description

As a user I want to limit flexibly results in every lane.

For instance, I have 100 cards in backlog 3 in progress and 1000 in done.
I want to configure facil to show only first (by sorting order) 10 in backlog,
all in progress, and 15 in done. All other cards I do not want to see, by default.
Meanwhile I want to have possibility to show all cards with some flag.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Every lane have configuration value: limit (none or 10 by default).
2. fl status shows results accordingly to limits in config.
3. fl status has flag --all to show all cards.
4. fl status has flag --limit (-n) + number to limit total amount of cards in output.
