# Sort lanes in status output.

## Description

As a user I want to have possibility to configure order of the lanes
in the output of the status command.

For instance I want to see backlog at the top, then day, then week,
then in progress, then done.

## Acceptance criteria

1. fl status uses priority value from config for every board, lowest value
   is the highest priority.
2. fl status shows the boards in the following order:

   * any of the lanes with the initial flag
   * boards without any flags sorted (asc) by priority value
   * any of the lanes with the final flag

3. If there are several lanes with initial or final flags, then only
   one of them is treated as the real initial/final lane. All other
   lanes are treated as ordinary lanes.
