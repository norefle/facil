# Task moving

## Description

As a *user* I want to be able to move tasks from one state to another.

Here are the rules to moves cards:

  1 If name of the lane on board to moved wasn't specified explicitly
    card should be moved to the next lane accordingly to the order in config.
  2 If name of the lane was specified task should be moved to this lane.
  3 If task was moved to the final lane, its state changes to "closed".

## Optional

### Task id

Task can be specified by full or partial id, where:

  * Full id is the uuid of task.
  * Partial id is the part (1 or more) first symbols of task.

If partial id isn't unique, error message should be provided to ask user
specify more detailed partial/full id.

### WIP

Move command should use WIP limits from config for every lane on the board.

  * Less or equal to 0 means no limits.
  * All other values mean amount of cards on the lane.

If user asked to move card to the lane, and new amount of cards on this lane
exceeded WIP limit, then error message should be provided and move operation
have to be aborted.

## Acceptance criteria

* cli has move command with the following syntax: fl move TASK [LANE]
