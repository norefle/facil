# Bug: fl create ignores initial lane.

## Description

If initial lane in the config file differs from "backlog"
then "fl create" ignores that folder and recreates "backlog" one.


## Acceptance criteria

* fl create creates and puts task into the initial folder, not the
  hardcoded "backlog" one.
